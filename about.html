        <h2>Help us recover Speedy!</h2>
        <p>Robot SPD 13:

            Speedy is one of our latest models, extremely specialized and as <em>expensive as a battleship.</em>
            Thus, he is not a thing to be destroyed lightly.  Thus, in his case, Rule 3 has been strengthened.
            He is also among the fastest robot models ever created...which turned out to be a problem. <br>

            We need to recover Speedy at pretty much all costs.  The environment on Mercury is extremely hostile,
            and we rely on the Selenium gathered by Speedy to run our environmental controls.
            If Speedy doesn't return soon with the materials, we're all in trouble! <br>

            As of right now, our data is telling us that Speedy is running <em>in a big circle.</em> <br> <br>
        </p>
