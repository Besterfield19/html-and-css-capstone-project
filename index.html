        <h2>The First Law of Robotics:</h2>
        <p>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</p>

        <h2>The Second Law of Robotics:</h2>
        <p>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</p>

        <h2>The Third Law of Robotics:</h2>
        <p>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First and Second Laws.</p>
